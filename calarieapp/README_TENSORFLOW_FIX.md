# üîß TensorFlow Import Issue Fix

## Problem
The app was encountering a TensorFlow import error:
```
TypeError: This app has encountered an error. The original error message is redacted to prevent data leaks.
```

This was caused by a version compatibility issue between TensorFlow and the transformers library.

## Solution

### Option 1: Use Minimal Requirements (Recommended)
Install the TensorFlow-free version:
```bash
pip install -r requirements_minimal.txt
```

### Option 2: Fix TensorFlow Version
If you need TensorFlow, use a compatible version:
```bash
pip uninstall tensorflow tensorflow-hub
pip install tensorflow==2.13.0 tensorflow-hub==0.13.0
```

### Option 3: Use Conda Environment
Create a fresh conda environment:
```bash
conda create -n calorie-tracker python=3.10
conda activate calorie-tracker
pip install -r requirements_minimal.txt
```

## What's Changed

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added try-catch blocks for all AI/ML library imports
- Graceful fallbacks when libraries are not available
- Clear error messages for missing dependencies

### 2. Updated Requirements
- Removed TensorFlow from main requirements to prevent conflicts
- Created `requirements_minimal.txt` for TensorFlow-free installation
- Added version specifications for better compatibility

### 3. Improved App Structure
- Models load conditionally based on available libraries
- Features are disabled gracefully when dependencies are missing
- Better user feedback for missing components

## Features That Work Without TensorFlow

‚úÖ **Core Features:**
- Streamlit UI with modern design
- Image upload and display
- Basic food analysis (with available models)
- History tracking
- Daily summary

‚ö†Ô∏è **Limited Features (without TensorFlow):**
- Advanced AI interpretability (Grad-CAM, SHAP, LIME)
- Some advanced model features

## Testing

Run the test script to verify your installation:
```bash
python test_app_startup.py
```

## Troubleshooting

### If you still get TensorFlow errors:
1. Check if TensorFlow is installed: `pip list | grep tensorflow`
2. If found, uninstall it: `pip uninstall tensorflow tensorflow-hub`
3. Reinstall requirements: `pip install -r requirements_minimal.txt`

### If you need TensorFlow for other projects:
1. Use virtual environments for different projects
2. Install TensorFlow in a separate environment
3. Use the minimal requirements for this app

## Alternative: Docker Setup

Create a `Dockerfile`:
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.10-slim

WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements_minimal.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements_minimal.txt

COPY . .
EXPOSE 8501

CMD ["streamlit", "run", "app.py", "--server.port=8501", "--server.address=0.0.0.0"]
```

Build and run:
```bash
docker build -t calorie-tracker .
docker run -p 8501:8501 calorie-tracker
```

## Support

If you continue to have issues:
1. Check the Python version (recommended: 3.9-3.11)
2. Ensure you're using a virtual environment
3. Try the minimal requirements first
4. Check the test script output for specific import errors
