# 🚀 Streamlit Cloud Deployment Guide

## Overview
This guide will help you deploy your AI-Powered Nutrition Analysis app to Streamlit Cloud for free.

## 📋 Prerequisites

1. **GitHub Account**: You need a GitHub account to host your code
2. **Streamlit Account**: Sign up at [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
3. **GitHub Repository**: Your code must be in a public GitHub repository

## 🛠️ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Your Repository

1. **Create a GitHub Repository**:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: AI-Powered Nutrition Analysis App"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Ensure Required Files Are Present**:
   - ✅ `app.py` (main application file)
   - ✅ `requirements.txt` (Python dependencies)
   - ✅ `.streamlit/config.toml` (Streamlit configuration)
   - ✅ `yolo11m.pt` (YOLO model file)
   - ✅ `utils/` directory (utility functions)

### Step 2: Deploy to Streamlit Cloud

1. **Go to Streamlit Cloud**:
   - Visit [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
   - Sign in with your GitHub account

2. **Create New App**:
   - Click "New app"
   - Select your repository
   - Set the main file path to: `app.py`
   - Click "Deploy!"

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables (Optional)

If you're using GROQ API for enhanced analysis:

1. **Get GROQ API Key**:
   - Sign up at [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com)
   - Create a new API key
   - Copy the API key

2. **In Streamlit Cloud Dashboard**:
   - Go to your app settings
   - Add environment variable: `GROQ_API_KEY`
   - Set the value to your GROQ API key

3. **Test GROQ Integration** (Optional):
   ```bash
   python test_groq_integration.py
   ```

## ⚙️ Configuration Details

### Streamlit Config (`.streamlit/config.toml`)
- **Headless mode**: Enabled for cloud deployment
- **CORS disabled**: For better performance
- **Custom theme**: Matches your app's green color scheme
- **Usage stats disabled**: Privacy-focused

### Requirements (`requirements.txt`)
- **Core dependencies**: Streamlit, PyTorch, YOLO
- **Computer vision**: OpenCV, Pillow, Ultralytics
- **Data processing**: Pandas, NumPy, Plotly
- **AI/ML**: LangChain, GROQ integration

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

### Model Loading
- YOLO11m model is loaded once and cached
- Image optimization reduces processing time
- Efficient memory usage for cloud deployment

### Caching Strategy
- Model loading is cached with `@st.cache_resource`
- Image processing results are cached
- Session state management for user data

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Model File Too Large**:
   - ✅ YOLO11m.pt (39MB) is within Streamlit Cloud limits
   - ✅ Model is loaded efficiently with caching

2. **Memory Issues**:
   - ✅ Image optimization reduces memory usage
   - ✅ Efficient data structures used

3. **Dependency Conflicts**:
   - ✅ All dependencies are properly versioned
   - ✅ No conflicting package versions

### Deployment Checklist

- [ ] All files committed to GitHub
- [ ] Repository is public
- [ ] `app.py` is the main file
- [ ] `requirements.txt` is present
- [ ] `.streamlit/config.toml` is configured
- [ ] YOLO model file is included
- [ ] Environment variables set (if needed)
